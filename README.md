# Quiz-Challenge

https://lnguyen95uzi.github.io/Quiz-Challenge/

This was a challenging activity featuring HTML, CSS, and javascript to create a Trivia Quiz Game for players to enjoy! Majority of the HTML is powered by javascript and incorporates the use of a timer, for loop, button click, local storage for past scores, as well as a reset button!

Answering correctly keeps the timer running normally while answering incorrectly lowers the time 3 seconds. 

Players are able to save their initials at the end and then keep track of their scores!
